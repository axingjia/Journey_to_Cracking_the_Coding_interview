# Journey to Cracking the Coding Interview

Again, it's a notetaking repo. 

If I have the book I can probably take notes on the book, but it wouldn't beat taking notes on a notebook.

And taking notes on github means I can check it anywhere, don't know the usefulness of this, but I can at least try.


### chapter 7: Technical Question
* Don't read question and answer, try to do it
* Advanced: write the code on paper.
* Test your code 
* Type your apper code as-is into a computer
* try to do as many mock interviews as possible

As for Data Structure, you are usually only expected to basics. Here are teh absolute, must have knowledge:

* Linked Lists
* Tree, Tries, Graphs
* Stacks, Queues
* Heaps
* Vector/ ArrayLists
* Hash Tables
* Breath-First Search
* Depth First Search
* Binary Search
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort 
* Bit Manipulation 
* Memory (Stack vs. Heap)
* Recursion
* Dynamic Programming
* Big O TIme & space

Make sure you know how to use them and implement them

Practice implementing the data structures (on paper, then on computer)

In particular, hash tables are an extremely important topic.

**A good way to find things quickly is using a hashtable**

* StringBuilder avoid the problem of iterative string concatanation

(A bit of digression here. Need to dive deeper into linkedList and other data structure. By just reading the code isn't not getting into my brain.I think the reason why it's not getting into me is I don't fully understand the steps, even though I read it and understand it. Well, I just need to implement it with psuedo code myself and then check it. Probably will give it half an hour for this purpose)

(Also need to watch videos on Bit Manipulation, need to watch some videos about it)

(And of course need to figure out Tree and Graph, go through textbook to figure it out)

(And the rest like Object-oriented and recursion and dynamic programming is not at the last end of the to-do queue here)
